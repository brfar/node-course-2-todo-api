	 * without it, the token is not foolproof: let's say the user changes the data id property to 5. All
	 * they have to do is rehash that data, add it on to the rash properties, send the token back and they
	 * technically would trick us.
	 * We wanna have a secret added onto the end, like 'somescret' and this is gonna salt our hash. Now the
	 * user is not gonna be able to manipulate this data anymore. They could change the ID from 4 to 5, they
	 * could try to rehash, but they're not gonna have the secret, so their hash is gonna be bad. When we then
